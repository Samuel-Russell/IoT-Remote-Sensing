# Remote-Sensing-Algorithms
A collection of useful algorithms for remote sensing applications primarily focused on utilising single board computers and additional sensors.

## Scripts
'Read_DHT22_Data.py' is a script for reading temperature and humidity data from the DHT22 sensor connected to the Raspberry Pi. It has a widee range of applications such as monitoring the interior conditions of a commercial or residential building to remote sensing the conditions inside of a greenhouse and other agricultural settings.
